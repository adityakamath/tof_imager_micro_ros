# tof_imager_micro_ros
Micro-ROS nodes that publish the pointcloud from a [VL53L5CX](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18642) or a [VL53L7CX](https://www.pololu.com/product/3418/resources) ToF Imager. Implemented using a Teensy 4.1 (using Serial) and an Arduino Portenta (using WiFi UDP). In both the implementations, sensor data is read via I2C, converted into a pointcloud and published using a [Pointcloud2 message](https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud.html)
